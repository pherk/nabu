Nabu SPZ Partner

**update to v0.9 done**

The application supports the management of a SPZ ambulance. FHIR resources are used to map the data and relationships.
Roadmap:
- v1.0 Reporting, eLetter
- v0.9 EpisodeofCare-CareTeam, Golem
- v0.8 CarePlan-Workflows and many more FHIR-datatypes.
The application is actively developed in XQuery and small portions in Javascript. The app and XML data are stored on a eXistDB-Server (4.2-master).

The application source is not yet available.  
The repository is momentarily serving only for issue tracking in the context of update to v0.9.

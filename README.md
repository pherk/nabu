Nabu SPZ Partner

The application supports the management of a SPZ ambulance. FHIR resources are used to map the data and relationships.
The upcoming version 0.8 implements CarePlan-Workflows.
The application is actively developed in XQuery and small portions in Javascript. The app and XML data are stored on a eXistDB-Server.

The application source is not yet available. The repository is momentarily serving only for issue tracking.

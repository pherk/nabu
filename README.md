Nabu SPZ Partner

**update to v0.8 done**

The application supports the management of a SPZ ambulance. FHIR resources are used to map the data and relationships.
The upcoming version 0.8 implements CarePlan-Workflows and many more FHIR-datatypes.
The application is actively developed in XQuery and small portions in Javascript. The app and XML data are stored on a eXistDB-Server (3.5-snapshot).

The application source is not yet available.  
The repository is momentarily serving only for issue tracking in the context of update to v0.8.
